# Getting started

These exercises will be used for the summer course Drones for computer vision applications. 
Computer vision part of the course is taught by Henrik Skov Midtiby.

From a linux command line you can install the python dependencies
and run the provided solution to the first exercise using these commands:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
cd 01_getting_started/solutions
python ex01_draw_on_empty_image.py
```

The program itself will not show anything in the terminal, but it will save an 
image in the output directory.


## Downloading input files for exercises

Some of the exercises rely on large input files. To get access to those, enter the input directory and run the command

```
make download_images
```
